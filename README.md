# Maze

A program that allows you to generate a maze of an arbitrary size, solve it, save it to file and retrieve it.

Maze generation is achieved by Kruskalâ€™s algorithm implementation. At first, maze is represented as a weighted graph where weights are randomly assigned. Edges are sorted and connected respectively making a fairly convincing looking maze.

For solving recursive DFS is implemented but BFS or A* with some heuristic might be added in the future.
